INFO: 	 DAVE:	 Based on your monthly salary of $101 and a desired loan amount of $125, let's continue with some additional questions to find the best fit for you.

Please provide your minimum age (16, 18, or older).

INFO: 	 DAVE:	 Based on your information and the criteria provided:

- **Loan Amount**: $125 (falls within Products 1 ($>100), 2 ($<1000), etc.)
- **Monthly Salary**: $101 (meets Product 1's minimum but not Product 2)
- **Age**: 25 years old (meets all product requirements)
- **Marital Status**: Yes

After evaluating the criteria, **Product_1** is the best fit for your situation because it aligns with your monthly salary and meets all other necessary conditions. 

I would suggest to you **Product_1**, that you will have to give back in 3 to 6 months.
