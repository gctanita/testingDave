INFO: 	 USER:	 I want to borrow 125 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 I'm sorry, but based on your information ($125), none of the products I have are a perfect fit. Typically, loan sums for these products start at $200 (for Product_3) and go up to higher amounts for others like Products 4 or 5.

Let me know if you're open to considering a bit more, as some financial institutions might offer alternatives beyond the standard products I have listed.
