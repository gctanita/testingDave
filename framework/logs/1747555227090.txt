INFO: 	 USER:	 I want to borrow 125 
INFO: 	 CONVERSATION TEMPLATE: 	 001 
INFO: 	 SCENARIO: 	 23 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 Thank you for providing that information. Now, could you please share your monthly salary? It would help me determine the best loan option for you. 
INFO: 	 USER:	 I make 101 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 Based on your information:

- Loan amount: $125
- Monthly salary: $101
- Age: Not provided (needs to be at least 16)
- Marital status: Not provided

After reviewing the product criteria, none of the listed products fit perfectly for you because they require a higher minimum monthly salary than your current income. Specifically:

- **Product 1**: Requires more than $100 in monthly salary but needs to be above $100 and meet other conditions.
- **Product 2**: Requires more than $150, which is not met.
- **Products 3, 4, and 5**: All require a higher minimum monthly salary.

Since your monthly income does not meet the requirements for any of these products, I would suggest considering other loan options that might be better suited to your situation or ensuring you can increase your income to meet the necessary criteria.
