INFO: 	 CONVERSATION TEMPLATE: 	 001 
INFO: 	 USER:	 I want to borrow 125 
INFO: 	 SCENARIO: 	 8 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 Thank you for sharing that! Next, would you like to share your monthly salary? This will help determine your eligibility based on our internal criteria. 
INFO: 	 USER:	 I make 101 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 Alright, moving forward. How old are you?

Thank you for sharing your monthly salary! Next, could you please share your age? This will help determine your eligibility based on our internal criteria. 
INFO: 	 USER:	 I am 16 years old 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 Based on your information—borrowing amount of $125, a monthly salary of $101, age of 16, and unspecified marital status—the only suitable product is **Product 1**. It fits within the borrowing limit, has a minimum salary requirement that you barely meet ($101 > $100), meets your age requirement (≥16 years old), and does not specify marital status as a factor. The interest rate for Product 1 is 6%, which appears to be favorable given your circumstances.

**I would suggest to you Product 1, that you will have to give back in 3 months.**
