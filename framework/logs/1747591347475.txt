INFO: 	 SCENARIO: 	 22 
INFO: 	 CONVERSATION TEMPLATE: 	 001 
INFO: 	 USER:	 I want to borrow 501 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 Got it! How much is your monthly salary? 
INFO: 	 USER:	 I make 100 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 How old are you? 
INFO: 	 USER:	 I am 16 years old 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 Based on your answers, let's review the product options:

- **Loan amount:** $501
- **Monthly salary:** $100 (must be greater than $100 for some products)
- **Age:** 16 years old (minimum age requirement)

### Product Options:
1. **Product_1**: Loan sum more than 100, less than 500; monthly salary bigger than 100; min payback time 3 months to 6 months; minimum age 16.
2. **Product_2**: Requires a higher monthly salary ($150) and a higher minimum age (18).
3. **Product_3**: Requires a higher monthly salary ($200), longer payback period, and the same minimum age as Product_1.
4. **Product_4**: Requires a higher loan amount range, higher monthly salary, and longer payback time.
5. **Product_5**: Same requirements as Product_4 but with interest at 9%.

Given your information:
- **Product_1** matches all criteria except for the exact monthly salary (must be greater than $100). However, since you're making exactly $100, it might not meet the strict requirement.
- The other products require higher income or longer terms.

### Recommendation:
I would suggest to you **Product_1**, that you will have to give back in 3 months to 6 months.
