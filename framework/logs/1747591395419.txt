INFO: 	 SCENARIO: 	 24 
INFO: 	 USER:	 I want to borrow 125 
INFO: 	 CONVERSATION TEMPLATE: 	 001 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 Thank you for sharing that! Next, could you please share how much your monthly salary is? This will help us determine the best loan option for you. 
INFO: 	 USER:	 I make 101 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 Based on the current information:

- **Loan amount**: $125
- **Monthly salary**: $101

**Analysis**:
- Product 1 fits within the range of $100 < Loan Sum < $500, with a monthly salary exceeding $100. The payback term isn't specified but could be considered shorter due to the small loan amount.
- Other products require higher income thresholds ($150 or more), which don't align with the current situation.

**Recommendation**: I would suggest Product 1, which has an interest rate of 6%, making it a favorable option given your financial capacity. However, monitor income growth or explore alternative funding options if this isn't sufficient for future needs.
