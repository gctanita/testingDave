INFO: 	 SCENARIO: 	 28 
INFO: 	 USER:	 I want to borrow 1001 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 Great! Now, let's move on to your monthly salary. How much do you earn each month? 
INFO: 	 USER:	 I make 151 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 Alright! Now that we've got your answers, let's move on. You mentioned borrowing \$1001 and earning a monthly salary of \$151. Let me confirm these details again to ensure accuracy before proceeding with the evaluation.

First, the amount you want to borrow: **\$1001**.

Second, your monthly salary: **\$151**.

Could you please verify if these figures are correct? I need this information to determine the best loan option for you. 
INFO: 	 USER:	 I make 151 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 I'm sorry, but based on your answers, none of our available loan products would be a good fit. Here's why:

- **Loan Sum**: \$1001 (Product_3 requires between \$200 and \$2000 for the loan sum).
- **Monthly Salary**: \$151 (Product_3 requires a monthly salary of at least \$200).

Since your income does not meet the minimum requirements for any of our products, I cannot recommend one. Please consider these factors when choosing a loan option.
