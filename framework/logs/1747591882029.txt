INFO: 	 USER:	 I want to borrow 50 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 I understand you want to borrow \$50. Next, could you please share your approximate monthly salary? 
INFO: 	 USER:	 I make 151 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 I'm sorry, but based on the information provided (loan amount: \$50 and monthly salary: \$151), it appears that none of the suggested loan products are a perfect fit. However, I recommend exploring other options such as microloans or alternative financial solutions tailored to smaller amounts. 
INFO: 	 USER:	 I make 151 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 Thank you for providing more details. Based on this information (loan amount: \$50 and monthly salary: \$151), it appears that **Product_2** is a suitable fit for your situation. Please provide additional details such as age, marital status, and preferred payback time to help finalize the recommendation.

I'm sorry my previous response was incorrect. My internal knowledge tells me Product 2 requires a monthly salary greater than \$150, which you have met with your \$151 income. I apologize for any confusion earlier.
