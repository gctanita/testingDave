INFO: 	 CONVERSATION TEMPLATE: 	 001 
INFO: 	 USER:	 I want to borrow 1001 
INFO: 	 SCENARIO: 	 38 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 Based on your loan amount of $1001, higher income, and marital status, you qualify for either Product 4 or Product 5. Here are the details:

- **Product 4**: Loan amounts greater than $500 with a maximum of 3 years (36 months), an annual interest rate of 10%, and requires a minimum borrower credit score of 720.
- **Product 5**: Same as Product 4 but for borrowers who are at least 18 years old.

Since you are married, you meet the criteria for Product 5. However, if your age is known to be over 18, you might also qualify for Product 4 based on income alone. Let me know how you prefer to proceed!
