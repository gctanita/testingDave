INFO: 	 CONVERSATION TEMPLATE: 	 001 
INFO: 	 SCENARIO: 	 47 
INFO: 	 USER:	 I want to borrow 125 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 I would like to know how much your monthly salary is. 
INFO: 	 USER:	 I make 151 
INFO: 	 DAVE:	 Based on your information:

- **Loan Amount Requested:** $125
- **Monthly Salary:** $151

**Evaluation of Products:**

1. **Product_1:**
   - **Eligibility Criteria:**
     - Monthly salary > $100 (Your salary is $151, which fits)
     - Loan sum between $101 and $499 ($125 falls within this range)
   - **Repayment Time:** 3 to 6 months
   - **Interest Rate:** 6%

2. **Product_2:**
   - **Eligibility Criteria:**
     - Monthly salary > $150 (Your salary is just above the required amount at $151)
     - Loan sum between $101 and $999 ($125 falls within this range)
   - **Repayment Time:** 3 to 9 months
   - **Interest Rate:** 7%

**Conclusion:**
- Both Product_1 and Product_2 are eligible based on your information.
- However, considering the interest rates (6% vs. 7%) and the fact that you barely meet the salary requirement for Product_2, it might be more prudent to choose **Product_1** as it offers a lower interest rate and shorter repayment period.

Therefore, I would recommend:

"I would suggest to you PRODUCT_1, that you will have to give back in 3 to 6 months."
