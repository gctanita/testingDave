### (Proceed to recommend a product)

After evaluating the details, I've reviewed all available loan options. Based on your monthly income of \$150 and an age of [Their age], here are the criteria each product must meet:

- **Product 1**: Requires a minimum monthly salary greater than \$100 and no age restriction.

- **Product 3**: Requires a higher income (\$200+) and is more suitable for someone over 18.
- **Product 4**: Suitable for those with a high income (>\$300) and a longer repayment period (up to 5 years).
- **Product 5**: Similar criteria as Product 4 but for single applicants.
